For everyone reporting an issue, Make sure to include a logcat as well as a dmesg report for each issue you report. It helps the team narrow down the problem and cuts down on time for a fix.

Before Reporting an issue please verify you did a factory and dalvik wipe before installing the current build and did not just install it over as that will cause issues and also that way we know we're troubleshooting a clean installation.

I am seeing alot of reports that basically just have a title and nothing else, no information on the build your using or logcat/dmesg.

Example of bad issue report: Such and such isn't working. No logcat, No dmesg, No other information. **END REPORT.**

For anyone who want to send an error report, the proper way to do it is with a corresponding **logcat**: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1726238 . You should also indicate the build that you have installed in your device (cm-XX-XXXXX-UNOFFICIAL-device.zip).

All incomplete error reports will be closed

All the latest releases will be posted here so make sure to check back often to check the progress of fixes, updates, and more.
